## k0rd

 This goals of this project are to make working with k3s even easier than it
 already is. K0rd is a tool to burn ramdisk images of k3s and launch them onto
 distributed metal providers.

 ### How can you contribute

 Currently k0rd is in an alpha state and needs help with pretty much everything. Code reviews of what already exsists would be a fantastic place to start contributing to k0rd.
